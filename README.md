# Airbrake for Kohana

> [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io) collects errors generated by other applications, and aggregates the results for review.

## Overview

This module provides drop-in exception handling for Kohana. Any uncaught exceptions encountered will be POSTed to the Airbrake server specified in your environment along with relevant data (`$_SERVER`, request params, backtrace, etc.).

Airbrake features:

* GitHub aware - In Airbrake, you can link code in your backtraces to the corresponding locations on GitHub.

* RSS - You can subscribe to an RSS feed of error activity on Airbrake

* Dupe detection - Rather than an email for every error, duplicate errors will be sent only once

* SSL secure - With paid plans, notifications can be sent over SSL to keep your data completely private.

* Experimental [support for Javascript](http://help.airbrake.io/kb/troubleshooting-2/javascript-notifier)

More salesy goodness can be seen on the [official Airbrake website](http://airbrake.io).

## Installation

You can install this module by either cloning:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/gevans/kohana-airbrake modules/airbrake
```

Adding as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add git://github.com/gevans/kohana-airbrake modules/airbrake
```

Or, downloading an [archive of the repository](https://github.com/airbrake/kohana-airbrake/downloads).

After that, you can enable Airbrake in your application's `bootstrap.php` by adding the following line to your modules definition:

```php
Kohana::modules(array(
    'airbrake' => MODPATH.'airbrake', // Airbrake exception handling and notifications
    // ...
));
```

## Configuration

* Register an account at [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io) (A rate-limited, single project plan is available for free).

* Create a new project in the Airbrake account manager.

* View your project, and make note of the API key.

* Copy `modules/airbrake/config/airbrake.php` to your application's config directory.

* Update the configuration file with your API key and make tweaks, if needed.

* Enjoy super-awesome-ultra-efficient notifications and exception handling.

## More Information

The module's classes are well documented and should satisfy you for most of your hacking. Unfortunately, there are no unit tests at this time, though I will reward you with many Internet points for making a pull request with improvements.

The [Airbrake knowledge base](http://help.airbrake.io/kb) has a large amount of information.

## Contributing

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn’t been implemented or the bug hasn’t been fixed yet.

* Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gevans/kohana-airbrake/issues) to make sure someone already hasn’t requested it and/or contributed it.

* Fork the project.

* Start a feature/bugfix branch.

* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.

* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don’t break it in a future version unintentionally.

* Please try not to mess with the version or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

This module is a shameless rip-off/translation of the [official Ruby gem](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake). A few snippets are borrowed from [@ahutchings](https://github.com/ahutchings)'s [kohana-hoptoad](https://github.com/ahutchings/kohana-hoptoad) module as well.
